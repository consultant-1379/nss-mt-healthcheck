Steps:
Nodes VM:
1.  Run all_getNodes.sh to get the nodes details in allNodes.job file.
2. Make 1.job 10.job etc., files with same number of nodes as per file name.
3.Copy these .job files to stubs vm.

Stubs VM:
1. Create directories with all node names in the path /var/tmp/esc . And copy mkdirNode.sh , check.sh and del.sh to /var/tmp/esc path.
    Note: Use mkdirNode.sh with hard code changes.
2. Run trigger.sh to enable pm subscription on the given nodes.
3. Then , Run res.sh to pause the pm collection.
4. After waiting for required number of ROPs , run resume.sh to resume pm collection.
5. Now, collect sar manually (e.g., sar 1 | tee sar_160_3.log) from immediate ROP start time untill all the files are collected correctly in /var/tmp/esc path.
    Note: e.g., If PM collection paused for 3 ROPs , there should be 4 files for each node.
    Note: In /var/tmp/esc path,  check.sh can be used to verify the files collected and  del.sh can be used to delete unwanted files collected for current test.
6. Run  sarstop.sh with input of sar file which is collected manually.
    Note: before running sarstop.sh , Remove starting line of the sar file as sar startTime presents on second line.
7. Observe the stats in totalstat.log
8. Repeat the same with multiple ROPs and multiple nodes.
