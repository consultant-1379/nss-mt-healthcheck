MO Rate Capability Calculator Scripts

 NSS-17833 : max NEs that can sync with MO rate (? MO/sec), by 1 NETSim VM

 ===============================================

 Step 1 : Run __collector.sh__ on target netsim vm

 Step 2 : Connect to corresponding ENM's MSCM

 Step 3 : Copy __trigger.sh__,__actionrunner.sh__,__sarcollect.sh__,__sarstop.sh__and  .job file generated by collector.sh to MSCM.

 Step 4 : Run __trigger.sh__

         Note: This trigger.sh can also calculates the CPU usage into the file totalstat.log and copies this file to target VM(nodes VM ) .

         Wait for prmn files to be generated for our usecase, which will be generated at 10th min
         on netsimvm


#### on target netsim vm ####

Step 5 : Run __analyzer.sh__ on netsimvm which generates prmnrequest and prmnresponse files and calculates MO rate.

        analyzer.sh generate report for each job as <JOB_ID>.csv

Note :

      * In generateresponse.sh and generaterequest.sh files, change the varibale beam as per the OS. i.e, it should be like */linux/* for centOS VM   and */suse11/* for Suse11 VM.
     * If there is any change prmn schema make sure to update extract.sh script. This will
                 also lead to error/ invalid results if not updated accordingly.

     * Make sure you run __analyzer.sh__ in directory where we generated .job,.sar files
                 which will be used by script
