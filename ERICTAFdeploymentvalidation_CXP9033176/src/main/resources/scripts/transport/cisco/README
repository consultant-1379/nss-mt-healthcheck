# CISCO PM file stub

# Copy the scripts to Client and Server NETSim VMs

# Server - VM where nodes are present.  Client - VM where stubs are run

# Generate the nodeips.txt in the Server VM by triggering the getNodes.sh script

# Copy the nodeips.txt file to the Client VM where scripts are present

# Trigger the stub from the Client VM using the below command
# sh ciscopmstub.sh -f get_pm_counters -n 40 -p SSH -s `hostname -i` -r 10.141.11.225 -i `date +%s`

# Run the analyzer.sh script in the Server VM after the script execution
# This will generate a finallog.txt file which will give the max netsim processing time for each node
