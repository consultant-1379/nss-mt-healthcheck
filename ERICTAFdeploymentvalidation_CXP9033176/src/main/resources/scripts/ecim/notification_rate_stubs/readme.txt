Notification Rate Capability Calculator Scripts
===============================================

Collecting Node Info - NETSIM VM
------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 : Run __collector.sh__ on target netsim vm, it takes  JOB_ID and number of nodes as input


Subscribing to nodes - MSCM
------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 : Connect to corresponding VM's MSCM
Step 3 : Copy __subscriber.sh__,__subscriberclient.sh__, .job generated by collector.sh to MSCM
Step 4 : Run __subscriber.sh__

Triggering AVC burst on nodes - NETSIM VM 
------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 : Run __trigger.sh__

NOTE : Make sure to use jobs with different JOB_ID if same configuration is used.
configuration : number of notifis , number of notifications, JOB_ID

Wait for Logs
------------------------------------------------------
Wait for prmn files to generated for our usecase, which will be generated at 10th min on netsimvm


Analyzing the logs
------------------------------------------------------
After next hour 15th minute,
Step 5 : Run __analyzer.sh__ on netsimvm by providing extracted
         prmm request and response files to the script.

NOTE : Make sure you run __analyzer.sh__ in directory where generated .req , .sar files are present
       which will be used by script
       * Make sure to update extract scripts if there is any change prmn schema. Otherwise would cause
        unexpected behaviour.

Analyzer.sh append results of each job to res.csv
