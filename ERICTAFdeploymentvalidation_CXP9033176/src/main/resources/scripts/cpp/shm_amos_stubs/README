Project: Stub for SHM actions on CPP nodes

Syntax:
./shmcppstub.sh -f <FUNCTION> -n <NUM_NODES> -p <PROTOCOL> -i <JOB_ID> -s <SERVER> -r <NETSIM SERVER>
             FUNCTION - amos
                        amos_ssh
                        amos_combined
                        swupgrade
                        brmbackup
            NUM_NODES - Should be less than or equal to the nodes mentioned in nodeips.txt file
            PROTOCOL - SSH/TLS
            JOB_ID - Unique id
            SERVER - Server IP to download upgrade package or export the backup file
            NETSIM_SERVER - Server IP where the nodes are present

Note:

1)Unique jobid can be created as below
jobid=`date +%s`

2)Copy the CXPL17BCP1_G1284.xml file to /var/tmp path in the FTP server
Corresponding server details has to be updated in the conf.txt file.

3)Generate the nodeips.txt file by running the script on the NETSim server where the nodes
are present. Copy the nodeips.txt file to the server where SHM stubs to be executed.

4)Script has to be executed to any other server where the nodes are reachable for ssh/ssl

Examples:

BACKUP:

The below command will create the backup, export to the FTP server, delete the backup after export

./shmcppstub.sh -f brmbackup -n 10 -i $jobid -s 10.141.11.186 -p TLS -r 10.141.11.187

CLEAN BACKUP:

SOFTWARE UPGRADE:

The below command will upgrade the package on the node

./shmcppstub.sh -f swupgrade -n 10 -i $jobid -s 10.141.11.186 -p TLS -r 19.141.11.187
