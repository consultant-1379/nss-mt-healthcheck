MO Rate Capability Calculator Scripts

NSS-20986 : GRAN: Max NEs that can sync with MO rate (270 MO/sec), by 1 NETSim VM

===============================================

Request DIR - /netsim/inst/netsimprmn
Response DIR - /netsim/inst/prmnresponse

------------------------------------------------------
Running usecase 
-------------------------------------------------
Tip : Refrain running use case @ last minutes of hour( > 55th minute ) , because request / response spill across 2 hours which sometime causes issues.

NETSIM VM:
Step 1 : Run __getNodes.sh__ on target netsim vm  | Note : Script takes all started nodes. Make sure that only usecase specific nodes are started. 

MSCM:
Step 2 : Connect to corresponding ENM's MSCM 
Step 3 : Copy __trigger.sh__,__actionrunner.sh__, allNodes.job generated by collector.sh to MSCM (steps to connect to MSCM provided below)
		

NETSIM VM:
Step 4 : Start collecting sar logs in netsim vm using command
	 sh sarCollector.sh <TIME_TO_COLLECT_LOGS>
	  TIME_TO_COLLECT_LOGS - Start with 60 secs for 10 nodes . For 100 nodes it takes 3 mins(180 seconds) to run the usecase.
	  Observe that sarCollector.sh should run while trigger is started and completed.

MSCM:
Step 5 :Run __trigger.sh__
	sh trigger.sh <NUM_NODES> >/dev/null
	<NUM_NODES> - number of nodes on which usecase has to be triggered.

NETSIM VM:
Step 7 : Run __analyzer.sh__  
	sh analyzer.sh <NUM_NODES> < REQ_MO_RATE>
	 Run script in directory which contains both .job and .sar files are present
        Analyzer.sh generate result and appends it to result.csv
	Observe the exit status : 0 (Passed) , 1(Failed)
	Passed if REQ_MO_RATE is satified by all triggered nodes


-------------------------------------
Finding Capabilities
-------------------------------------
* Observe result.csv files genarated by analyzer.sh which contains MORate as last column

Approach: Ideally start with 5 NEs, verify if MORate passes
* Keep increasing NEs untill MORate fails
* Check if all nodes are satifying required MORate even if a single node fails to achieve required MORate then it is a failure
* Then try reducing number of nodes a few continue till all nodes pass
-------------------------------------
---------
Notes : 
---------
* If there is any change prmn schema make sure to update extract.sh script. This will 
also lead to error/ invalid results if not updated accordingly.

* Running analyzer after every prmn generation is very important. Other wise , analyzer.sh
may produce unexpected results caused by accumilation of all runs logs under single prmn file.

* Make sure you run __analyzer.sh__ in directory where we generated .job,.sar files
which will be used by script
